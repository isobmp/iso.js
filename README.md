# iso.js
## A simple, yet effective function library
**iso.js** is a javascript library which has simple, premade functions, so that you don't have to rewrite code that has already been written.<br>
**iso.js** is compatible with every kind of script imagineable, as long as it has the same syntax as javscript 
###### (e.g. iso.js works with **Node.js**)
## Easy to rewrite
**iso.js** is built with *very, very VERY* basic javascript, so that even without knowing barely any **js**, you can modify the code.
```python

 o8o                             o8o          
 `"'                             `"'          
oooo   .oooo.o  .ooooo.         oooo  .oooo.o 
`888  d88(  "8 d88' `88b        `888 d88(  "8

                                 888          
                            .o. 88P          
                             `Y888P
